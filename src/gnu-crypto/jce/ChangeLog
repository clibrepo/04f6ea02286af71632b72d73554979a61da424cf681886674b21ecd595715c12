For GNU Crypto 1.1.0:
   + Removing anything that isn't needed to build the JCE libraries (the
     ASN.1 stuff is the only non-javax.crypto package kept).
   + The build environment itself has been added.
   + The `javax.crypto.JCEUtil' class now has a safety net to prevent
     infinite loops in the case where algorithm aliases are circular. Such
     as:
        Alg.Alias.Cipher.VLADIMIR=ESTRAGON
        Alg.Alias.Cipher.ESTRAGON=VLADIMIR
   + Each source file now has a short license declaration at the top; the
     oringinal sources had no such declaration.
   + The `javax/crypto/interfaces/PBEKey.java' interface has been added.


For Bouncy Castle release 1.16:

- Bug fix for 1.15 removed (the bug is fixed in BC 1.16). The source
  tree now consists entirely of Bouncy Castle's code.

For Bouncy Castle release 1.15:

+ Bug fix to the javax.crypto.Mac's clone() method.
