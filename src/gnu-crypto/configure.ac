# Initialise maintainer mode:
#     This macro adds a `--enable-maintainer-mode' option to
#     `configure'.  If this is used, `automake' will cause
#     `maintainer-only' rules to be turned off by default in the
#     generated `Makefile.in's. This macro defines the `MAINTAINER_MODE'
#     conditional, which you can use in your own `Makefile.am'.
